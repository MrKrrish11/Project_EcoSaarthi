# Ignore Node.js dependencies
node_modules

# Ignore environment variables file
.env

# (You can add other things to ignore here, like log files or system files)
```By adding `.env` to this file, you are telling Git to pretend this file doesn't even exist. It will never be tracked or committed.

**⚠️ Important Safety Check!**
If you have *already* committed your `.env` file by accident, you must remove it from Git's history. Run this command:
```bash
git rm --cached .env
